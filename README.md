# crypto-protfolio
This is a simple PWA that allows you to view your binance portfolio.
There is a pie chart to show you how your portfolio is distributed between coins and the value of the coins.
You can also see the current price and 24 hour change of any coins in your portfolio, as well as your open orders.
