# crypto-protfolio
This is a simple PWA that allows you to view your binance portfolio.
There is a pie chart to show you how your portfolio is distributed between coins and the value of the coins.
You can also see the current price and 24 hour change of any coins in your portfolio, as well as your open orders.

All you need to do is add you API key and secret in the app and your good to go!

note: any api-keys in this repository have since been changed and no longer work.
